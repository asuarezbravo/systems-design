# Module 15: Case Studies and Real-World Examples

## Introduction

Understanding the theory behind system design is crucial, but applying these concepts to real-world situations can be challenging. In this module, we will explore practical case studies of large-scale systems, dive into how industry leaders like Netflix, Amazon, and Google design and scale their systems, and analyze how they handle real-world challenges. We’ll also look at how systems are designed to handle sudden traffic spikes, how companies build systems for emerging markets, and what can be learned from system failures.

Finally, we’ll conclude by exploring trends in systems design and how engineers are building for the future. These case studies and examples will provide actionable insights into how theory is put into practice and how companies solve complex system design problems at scale.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [15.1. High-Scale System Design Case Study (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, Google)](./section_15_1.md)
- [15.2. Handling Sudden Traffic Spikes (e.g., Black Friday, Streaming Events)](./section_15_2.md)
- [15.3. Designing Systems for Emerging Markets](./section_15_3.md)
- [15.4. Retrospective: Learning from System Failures](./section_15_4.md)
- [15.5. Building for the Future: Trends in Systems Design](./section_15_5.md)

By the end of this module, you will have a deep understanding of how large-scale systems are designed and optimized, how to handle real-world challenges like traffic spikes, and how to apply lessons from system failures to improve reliability and scalability in future designs.
