# Module 7: Load Balancing and Traffic Management

## Introduction

As systems scale, distributing traffic effectively across multiple servers becomes critical to maintaining performance, availability, and reliability. Load balancing ensures that no single server is overwhelmed with requests, while traffic management helps optimize how requests are routed to different parts of the infrastructure.

In this module, we will explore key concepts such as **load balancing techniques**, **traffic distribution strategies**, and **health check mechanisms**. These strategies ensure that services remain available, even under high traffic conditions, and help improve overall system efficiency.

By the end of this module, you will have a deep understanding of how to implement and manage traffic routing solutions to build scalable and resilient systems.
