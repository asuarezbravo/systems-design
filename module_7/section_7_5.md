# 7.5. Health Checks and Failover Mechanisms

## Introduction

In distributed systems and load-balanced environments, ensuring that traffic is directed only to healthy and operational servers is crucial. **Health checks** are used to monitor the status of servers and services, while **failover mechanisms** automatically reroute traffic when failures are detected. Together, these mechanisms improve system reliability and ensure seamless user experiences even during server outages or service disruptions.

In this section, we will explore how health checks work, the types of health checks commonly used, and how failover mechanisms ensure continuity in service delivery.

## Health Checks

### 1. **How Health Checks Work**
- **Definition:** Health checks are regular tests performed by the load balancer or monitoring system to determine whether a server or service is operational and can handle requests.
- **Process:** The load balancer periodically sends requests (e.g., HTTP, TCP) to the servers. If the server responds successfully, it is considered healthy. If the server fails to respond or returns an error, it is marked as unhealthy, and traffic is no longer routed to it.

### 2. **Types of Health Checks**
- **TCP Health Checks:** Tests whether a server is reachable over a specific TCP port by establishing a connection. If the connection is successful, the server is considered healthy.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Health Checks:** Sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to a specific URL on the server. A successful status code (e.g., 200 OK) indicates that the server is healthy, while error codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) indicate a problem.
- **Application-Specific Health Checks:** Some systems implement custom health checks that verify specific application-level functionality, such as checking the status of a database or ensuring that a microservice is responsive.
  
### 3. **Frequency and Sensitivity**
- **Frequency:** Health checks are typically performed at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds), but the frequency can be adjusted based on the criticality of the service.
- **Sensitivity:** Some systems require a certain number of failed health checks before marking a server as unhealthy to avoid false positives. Similarly, a server may need to pass several consecutive checks before being marked as healthy again.

### 4. **Load Balancer Reaction**
- When a server fails health checks, the load balancer stops routing traffic to that server, preventing users from being directed to an unresponsive or broken service. Once the server recovers and passes health checks, the load balancer resumes sending traffic to it.

## Failover Mechanisms

### 1. **What is Failover?**
- **Definition:** Failover is the process of automatically rerouting traffic from a failed server or service to a backup or secondary server. Failover mechanisms ensure that when one component fails, another can take over to maintain service continuity.

### 2. **Active-Passive Failover**
- **Definition:** In an active-passive setup, one server (the primary server) handles all traffic, while another server (the passive server) remains on standby. When the primary server fails, the passive server takes over.
- **Benefits:** Simple to implement and cost-effective. The passive server is only used in case of failure, reducing operational overhead.
- **Drawbacks:** The passive server may have outdated data or require a longer failover time if it's not kept in sync with the primary server.

### 3. **Active-Active Failover**
- **Definition:** In an active-active setup, multiple servers are running simultaneously, and both handle traffic. If one server fails, the other continues handling requests without any downtime.
- **Benefits:** Provides better load distribution and reduces downtime, as all servers are actively used.
- **Drawbacks:** More complex to manage and requires synchronization between active servers to avoid data inconsistencies.

### 4. **Geographic Failover**
- **Definition:** Geographic failover (or multi-region failover) routes traffic to a different data center or region in the event of a complete data center outage.
- **Benefits:** Ensures global redundancy, making it possible to continue serving users even during regional disasters or outages.
- **Drawbacks:** Requires sophisticated global traffic management and synchronization between geographically distributed data centers.

## Best Practices for Health Checks and Failover

1. **Perform Frequent Health Checks:** Regularly test all critical servers and services to ensure quick detection of failures.
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Design your system to handle partial failures without collapsing entirely. For instance, if one microservice fails, other services should still operate.
3. **Use Active-Active Setup for Critical Systems:** For mission-critical systems where downtime is unacceptable, use active-active failover to ensure uninterrupted service.
4. **Monitor and Log Failures:** Set up proper monitoring and logging to track failures, health check results, and failover events. This helps with diagnosing issues and improving future reliability.
5. **Geographically Distributed Failover for Global Systems:** If you have a global user base, implement multi-region failover to ensure resilience against regional outages.

## Conclusion

Health checks and failover mechanisms are essential components of a resilient system architecture. By continuously monitoring the health of servers and automatically rerouting traffic when failures occur, these techniques help ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Implementing robust health check procedures and failover strategies allows your system to handle failures gracefully, minimizing downtime and preserving a seamless user experience.
