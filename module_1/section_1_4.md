# 1.4. Overview of Architecture Patterns

## Introduction

Architecture patterns are established, reusable designs that solve common system design problems. These patterns help define how components interact and how data flows through the system. Selecting the right architecture pattern is essential to building systems that meet business needs while supporting scalability, resilience, and performance.

In this section, we will explore common architecture patterns, including their advantages, disadvantages, and when to use them.

## Monolithic Architecture

A **monolithic architecture** is where all components of the application are bundled together into a single executable. While simple to implement, this architecture can introduce challenges in scalability and maintainability as the system grows.

## Microservices Architecture

A **microservices architecture** divides the application into small, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. This architecture improves fault isolation and scalability but introduces operational complexity.

## Event-Driven Architecture

An **event-driven architecture** enables components to communicate asynchronously via events, allowing for loose coupling and real-time processing. However, it also introduces challenges with debugging and ensuring consistency.

## Serverless Architecture

A **serverless architecture** allows developers to focus on writing code without managing infrastructure. This model automatically scales based on demand but can have performance issues like cold starts and limitations with long-running tasks.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right architecture pattern depends on the systemâ€™s complexity, scalability requirements, and operational needs. Monolithic, microservices, event-driven, and serverless architectures all have unique advantages and trade-offs, and selecting the best fit is essential for long-term system success.
