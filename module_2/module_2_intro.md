# Module 2: Architectural Approaches

## Introduction

In systems design, the choice of architecture defines how the components of a system interact, scale, and perform. Different architecture patterns serve different purposes, and choosing the right one can significantly impact a system’s scalability, maintainability, and resilience. Understanding various architectural approaches allows developers to make informed decisions based on the specific needs and growth potential of a system.

In this module, we’ll explore the most common architectural approaches used in software design, such as **Monolithic Architecture**, **Microservices Architecture**, **Event-Driven Architecture**, and **Serverless Architecture**, along with **Hybrid Architectures** for combining multiple approaches.
