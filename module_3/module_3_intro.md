# Module 3: Scalability Concepts

## Introduction

Scalability is one of the core design goals in building robust systems. It refers to the systemâ€™s ability to handle increasing load (traffic, data, or users) without degrading performance. Scalability is crucial for modern applications that need to grow to support millions of users or process massive amounts of data.

In this module, we will explore the fundamental concepts of scalability, covering the differences between **vertical and horizontal scaling**, **load balancing** techniques, **autoscaling**, and the challenges that arise in distributed systems. Understanding these concepts will equip you to design systems that not only scale but also maintain high performance under varying loads.
