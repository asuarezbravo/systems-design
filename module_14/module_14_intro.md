# Module 14: Cloud Infrastructure and Automation

## Introduction

As modern applications increasingly rely on cloud platforms, understanding how to effectively manage infrastructure in the cloud is essential. Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer a range of services and tools that enable developers to deploy, scale, and maintain applications with ease. In addition, automating infrastructure management through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and setting up **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines ensures smooth and reliable operations at scale.

This module covers key aspects of cloud infrastructure management, including a comparison of major cloud providers, infrastructure automation using IaC, building robust CI/CD pipelines, managing infrastructure at scale, and containerization with orchestration platforms like **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [14.1. Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP](./section_14_1.md)
- [14.2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](./section_14_2.md)
- [14.3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)](./section_14_3.md)
- [14.4. Managing Infrastructure at Scale](./section_14_4.md)
- [14.5. Containers and Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)](./section_14_5.md)

By the end of this module, you will have a clear understanding of cloud infrastructure management, automation techniques, and best practices for deploying and scaling modern applications using containers and orchestration platforms.
