# 5.1. Introduction to Caching

## Introduction

Caching is a technique used to store copies of data in temporary storage for faster retrieval. By storing frequently accessed data closer to the point of use, caching reduces latency, decreases the load on backend systems, and improves the overall user experience. In modern system design, caching plays a critical role in optimizing the performance and scalability of applications.

## Benefits of Caching

1. **Reduced Latency:** Caching allows for faster data retrieval by reducing the time spent accessing the original data source, especially when the data source is a remote server or database.
   
2. **Decreased Load on Backend Systems:** By serving frequently requested data from cache, you reduce the need for repeated queries to databases or API endpoints, alleviating the pressure on these systems.

3. **Improved User Experience:** Faster response times translate into a better user experience, as users perceive a more responsive and fluid application.

## Common Use Cases for Caching

1. **Database Caching:** Storing frequently queried database results in memory to avoid expensive and slow database lookups.
   
2. **Web Content Caching:** Caching static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in browsers or content delivery networks (CDNs) to reduce load times.

3. **API Caching:** Storing the results of API calls for a predefined period to avoid hitting the backend services repeatedly.
