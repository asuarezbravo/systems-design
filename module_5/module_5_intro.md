# Module 5: Caching and Optimization Techniques

## Introduction

Caching is a powerful optimization technique that improves the performance of systems by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in faster storage, reducing latency and decreasing the load on back-end resources. In modern system design, caching plays a crucial role in improving scalability, reducing response times, and enhancing user experience.

This module explores various caching techniques, including client-side and server-side caching, distributed caching solutions such as Redis and Memcached, strategies for cache invalidation, and how to optimize database queries for better performance.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how caching and optimization techniques can be applied to design systems that are not only fast but also scalable and efficient.
