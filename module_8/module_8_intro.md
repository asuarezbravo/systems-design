# Module 8: Stateless Services and Session Management

## Introduction

In modern distributed systems, designing stateless services is essential for achieving scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance. Stateless architectures allow systems to scale horizontally by ensuring that each service instance is independent and does not rely on previous requests or sessions. This enables dynamic load distribution, easier failover, and improved system resilience.

However, managing state across multiple interactions can still be necessary, especially in user-facing applications where session data must be preserved across requests. In these cases, strategies such as token-based authentication and externalized session management come into play, allowing systems to handle state efficiently without sacrificing scalability.

In this module, we will explore the benefits of stateless services, how to manage sessions effectively in distributed systems, and the use of techniques like **JWT**, **OAuth**, and **distributed session storage** to handle state.
