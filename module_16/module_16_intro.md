# Module 16: Capstone Project

## Introduction

The **Capstone Project** serves as the culmination of the Systems Design course, where you will apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout the modules to design and present a comprehensive system. This project will challenge you to define, design, and justify a high-level system architecture, addressing real-world considerations such as scalability, resiliency, and performance.

By completing the capstone project, you will not only demonstrate your ability to architect large-scale systems but also gain hands-on experience with system design principles. This final module will guide you through the process of defining your project scope, proposing a high-level design, and presenting your solution for evaluation.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [16.1. Defining the Project Scope](./section_16_1.md)
- [16.2. High-Level Design Proposal](./section_16_2.md)
- [16.3. System Architecture Design and Justification](./section_16_3.md)
- [16.4. Scalability and Resiliency Considerations](./section_16_4.md)
- [16.5. Project Presentation and Evaluation](./section_16_5.md)

### Objectives:
- **Project Scope Definition:** Clearly outline the problem you are addressing and the requirements of the system.
- **High-Level Design:** Propose a high-level architecture for your system, including key components and technologies.
- **Scalability and Resiliency:** Demonstrate how your system will scale to meet user demand and remain resilient in the face of failures.
- **Presentation and Justification:** Present your system design to peers or evaluators, providing a clear justification for your design decisions.

By the end of this module, you will have created a complete system design project, showcasing your ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical, real-world challenges.
