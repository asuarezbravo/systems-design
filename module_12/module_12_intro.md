# Module 12: Designing for Performance

## Introduction

Designing systems for high performance is crucial for ensuring that your application can handle increased load and deliver a fast, responsive user experience. Performance optimization is an ongoing process that involves monitoring, analyzing, and improving system behavior to achieve optimal throughput and low latency. As applications grow in complexity, performance becomes an even more critical factor that impacts user satisfaction and system scalability.

In this module, we will cover key topics related to system performance design, including performance metrics and benchmarks, techniques for reducing latency, optimizing throughput, conducting performance testing, and profiling systems to identify bottlenecks.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [12.1. Performance Metrics and Benchmarks](./section_12_1.md)
- [12.2. Reducing Latency in Distributed Systems](./section_12_2.md)
- [12.3. Throughput Optimization Techniques](./section_12_3.md)
- [12.4. Performance Testing and Load Simulation](./section_12_4.md)
- [12.5. Profiling and Identifying Bottlenecks](./section_12_5.md)

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how to measure and improve the performance of your systems, ensuring they are optimized to handle increased user traffic and deliver a seamless experience under load.
