# Module 9: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

## Introduction

As the internet becomes increasingly global and users demand faster access to web applications, **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** have emerged as a critical infrastructure component for improving web performance, scalability, and security. CDNs distribute content across geographically dispersed servers, allowing users to access data from the closest available server, which reduces latency and improves load times.

In this module, we will dive into the key concepts behind CDNs, how they improve performance, strategies for caching, the security features they offer, and how to implement a multi-CDN strategy for redundancy and enhanced performance.
