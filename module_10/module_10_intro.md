# Module 10: Security and Design

## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, ensuring the security of systems is a fundamental part of designing scalable, reliable, and robust applications. A well-thought-out architecture not only needs to handle performance and scalability but also must be secure by design. Security should be integrated into the development process from the outset, considering factors such as data protection, access control, secure communication, and resilience against common threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or SQL injection vulnerabilities.

This module focuses on best practices for **security in system design**, covering topics such as security models, encryption strategies, securing data at rest and in transit, and how to mitigate common threats. Additionally, we will discuss the principles of **secure system design** and the importance of embedding security into every layer of your architecture.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [10.1. Security Principles in System Design](./section_10_1.md)
- [10.2. Data Encryption (At Rest and In Transit)](./section_10_2.md)
- [10.3. Authentication and Authorization](./section_10_3.md)
- [10.4. Securing APIs and Microservices](./section_10_4.md)
- [10.5. Common Threats and Mitigation Techniques](./section_10_5.md)

By the end of this module, you will have a deeper understanding of how to integrate security into the design process, how to protect sensitive data, and how to defend your system against common security threats, ensuring a resilient and secure application infrastructure.
