# Module 1: Introduction to Systems Design

## Introduction

Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and interfaces of a system to meet specified requirements. As applications grow in complexity, size, and user demand, building software systems that can scale, maintain performance, and handle failures becomes crucial. High-level systems design focuses on making decisions that impact the overall structure and behavior of the software, rather than delving into low-level implementation details.

In this module, we’ll explore the core concepts of systems design and discuss why it is important in modern software development. We’ll introduce key goals such as **scalability**, **resilience**, and **performance**, and give a broad overview of the architectural patterns used to achieve these objectives.

By the end of this module, you'll have a foundational understanding of systems design principles that will be expanded upon in subsequent modules. Whether you're designing a small applicatio
