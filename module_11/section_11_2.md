# 11.2. Key Metrics to Monitor (CPU, Memory, Latency, etc.)

## Introduction

Monitoring a system involves tracking key performance metrics to ensure its health and reliability. These metrics provide critical insights into how your application and infrastructure are performing. Monitoring the right metrics allows teams to detect issues early, optimize resource usage, and ensure the system operates efficiently under load. 

In this section, we will cover the key metrics that are essential to monitor in any system, including **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, **latency**, **network throughput**, and **disk I/O**. We will also explore why these metrics matter and how to interpret them.

## 1. CPU Usage

### What It Is:
**CPU usage** measures the percentage of CPU capacity being used by the system over time. High CPU usage indicates that the system is under heavy load, which could lead to performance bottlenecks.

### Why It Matters:
- **Performance Indicator:** High CPU usage can signal that your system is handling too many processes simultaneously, causing performance degradation.
- **Capacity Planning:** By monitoring CPU usage trends, you can predict when additional computing resources may be required.
- **Prevent Overload:** Excessive CPU usage can cause slowdowns or even crashes. Monitoring allows you to take proactive steps to mitigate this.

### Best Practices:
- Set alerts for high CPU usage (e.g., over 80%) to avoid overloading servers.
- Identify and address processes consuming excessive CPU resources.

### Example:
A web server that handles many concurrent requests may experience high CPU usage during peak traffic periods. Monitoring CPU usage allows the system to auto-scale by adding additional instances to distribute the load.

## 2. Memory Usage

### What It Is:
**Memory usage** tracks the amount of system memory (RAM) being used. Excessive memory consumption can lead to poor performance, as the system may start swapping data to disk, which is significantly slower than accessing data from RAM.

### Why It Matters:
- **System Stability:** If memory usage exceeds available resources, the system may begin using swap space, significantly degrading performance.
- **Memory Leaks:** Persistent high memory usage could indicate memory leaks in the application, where memory is allocated but not properly released.
- **Efficiency:** Monitoring memory usage helps ensure that applications are using memory resources efficiently.

### Best Practices:
- Set memory usage thresholds (e.g., 80% of available RAM) to trigger alerts when memory consumption becomes critical.
- Regularly check for and resolve memory leaks.

### Example:
A high-memory-consuming process like a database query engine can slow down an application if it uses too much RAM. Monitoring memory usage allows the team to optimize queries or allocate more memory before performance suffers.

## 3. Latency

### What It Is:
**Latency** refers to the time it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and back. It is often measured in milliseconds (ms) and is a key performance indicator for user experience in web applications and distributed systems.

### Why It Matters:
- **User Experience:** High latency can cause slow page loads, poor response times in APIs, and degraded application performance.
- **Network and Application Health:** Latency can indicate problems with network connections, overloaded servers, or inefficient application logic.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Latency spikes can signal that certain services or components are underperforming.

### Best Practices:
- Monitor latency for all key transactions (e.g., API requests, database queries) to ensure they are within acceptable response times.
- Set thresholds to detect latency spikes and investigate the root cause.

### Example:
A microservices-based application monitors the latency between different services to ensure that internal communication remains fast and responsive. High latency between services could indicate network congestion or inefficient service interaction.

## 4. Network Throughput

### What It Is:
**Network throughput** measures the rate of data transfer across the network, typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps). It reflects the amount of data being transmitted over the network during a given period.

### Why It Matters:
- **Bandwidth Utilization:** Monitoring network throughput ensures that your infrastructure has enough bandwidth to handle current traffic and can prevent bottlenecks.
- **Detecting Bottlenecks:** Low throughput or sudden drops in throughput can signal network congestion or hardware issues.
- **Resource Scaling:** By monitoring throughput, teams can decide when to scale network resources to handle increased traffic.

### Best Practices:
- Monitor both inbound and outbound network throughput to ensure balanced traffic and adequate bandwidth.
- Set alerts for abnormal drops in throughput, which could indicate network issues.

### Example:
An e-commerce platform monitors network throughput during a major sale event to ensure that the system can handle increased traffic without network congestion.

## 5. Disk I/O (Input/Output)

### What It Is:
**Disk I/O** measures the speed and volume of read and write operations to disk. High disk I/O can be a performance bottleneck, especially for database-driven applications, as disk access is slower than accessing data from memory.

### Why It Matters:
- **Storage Bottlenecks:** High disk I/O can indicate that the system is waiting on read/write operations, slowing down the application.
- **Database Performance:** Monitoring disk I/O helps identify whether database queries are causing excessive disk access, slowing down the system.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Optimizing disk I/O usage can improve system performance and reduce storage costs.

### Best Practices:
- Monitor disk I/O to ensure read/write operations are efficient and within acceptable thresholds.
- Identify disk-heavy operations and optimize them (e.g., indexing database queries or caching frequently accessed data).

### Example:
A database server that handles frequent read/write operations monitors disk I/O to ensure queries are not overloading the storage system, allowing engineers to optimize query performance.

## 6. Error Rates

### What It Is:
**Error rates** refer to the number or percentage of failed requests, such as HTTP 500 errors, database errors, or application crashes. A rising error rate can indicate problems in application logic, infrastructure, or external dependencies.

### Why It Matters:
- **System Health:** High error rates are an indicator of potential issues with the application or infrastructure that need to be addressed immediately.
- **User Experience:** Frequent errors can lead to user dissatisfaction and lost business opportunities, making it crucial to resolve issues quickly.
- **Dependency Failures:** Monitoring error rates can help detect issues with external dependencies such as third-party APIs or services.

### Best Practices:
- Track error rates for all major components and services to ensure problems are detected early.
- Investigate root causes when error rates exceed normal thresholds to prevent further incidents.

### Example:
A microservices application tracks the number of failed API calls between services. If the error rate spikes, the system triggers an alert for engineers to investigate the issue, preventing cascading failures across the system.

## Conclusion

Monitoring the right metrics is key to maintaining the performance, reliability, and scalability of your system. By tracking CPU usage, memory, latency, network throughput, disk I/O, and error rates, teams can gain insights into how the system is performing and proactively address potential issues. Implementing comprehensive monitoring for these metrics will ensure that your system remains resilient and responsive, even under increased load.
