# Module 11: Monitoring, Logging, and Observability

## Introduction

As systems become more distributed and complex, it’s crucial to have visibility into their operation. **Monitoring, logging, and observability** are key practices that allow you to understand the health of your system, troubleshoot issues, and improve performance. Without proper monitoring and logging, identifying problems can be difficult and time-consuming, leading to longer downtimes and reduced reliability.

In this module, we will explore the importance of monitoring in system design, the key metrics to track, logging best practices, and the role of distributed tracing in microservices. Additionally, we’ll cover real-time alerting and incident management strategies to ensure quick responses to issues.

### Key Topics Covered:
- [11.1. Importance of Monitoring in Systems Design](./section_11_1.md)
- [11.2. Key Metrics to Monitor (CPU, Memory, Latency, etc.)](./section_11_2.md)
- [11.3. Logging Best Practices](./section_11_3.md)
- [11.4. Distributed Tracing for Microservices](./section_11_4.md)
- [11.5. Real-Time Alerting and Incident Management](./section_11_5.md)

By the end of this module, you will have a deep understanding of how to set up effective monitoring and logging for your system, how to make sense of the data collected, and how to implement real-time alerting systems to ensure your system remains reliable and efficient.
