# Module 6: Designing for High Availability and Fault Tolerance

## Introduction

High availability (HA) and fault tolerance are crucial for mission-critical applications that require minimal downtime and seamless performance in the face of failures. Systems designed with high availability ensure that services remain accessible even when individual components fail, while fault-tolerant systems can continue operating despite the failure of some of their parts.

In this module, we will cover the principles of designing systems that are resilient to failures, explore the role of redundancy and replication, and introduce disaster recovery strategies. We'll also discuss how to implement patterns like circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to ensure that your system can handle unexpected outages and failures.
