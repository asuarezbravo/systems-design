# 4.1. Database Design for High Availability

## Introduction

High availability (HA) refers to the ability of a system to remain operational even in the event of failures. In database design, ensuring high availability is crucial for maintaining continuous data access and preventing downtime. This section will explore different strategies for designing highly available databases, including replication, failover mechanisms, and distributed database systems.

## Replication Strategies for High Availability

- **Master-Slave Replication:** A common approach where one master database handles all writes, and multiple slave databases replicate and handle read queries.
- **Master-Master Replication:** A more complex approach where multiple master databases can handle both read and write queries, allowing for better redundancy and availability.
- **Multi-Data Center Replication:** This strategy involves replicating databases across multiple geographic regions to ensure availability even in the event of a data center failure.

## Failover Mechanisms

Automatic failover is essential for ensuring that systems remain available even if a primary database server goes down. Tools like **PostgreSQL with Patroni** or **MySQL with MHA** enable seamless failover.

## Conclusion

Designing databases for high availability is crucial for mission-critical applications. Using replication and failover mechanisms helps minimize downtime and ensures that systems can continue to operate even in the face of failures.
