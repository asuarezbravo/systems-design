# Module 4: Data Management Strategies

## Introduction

Data management is a critical aspect of system design, particularly as applications scale and data volumes grow. Efficiently managing data is essential for maintaining system performance, availability, and integrity. In this module, we will explore strategies such as database replication, sharding, distributed transaction management, and the CAP theorem to ensure your system can handle growing data demands while balancing consistency, availability, and scalability.

Weâ€™ll dive into different database architectures, strategies for scaling databases, and techniques for ensuring data consistency across distributed systems. By the end of this module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to design systems that efficiently manage data at scale.
